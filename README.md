# TSRCElectromes

This repository contains artifacts implemented during the development of the work reported in the paper "Time Series Reduction and Classification for ML-based Stress Detection in Plant Electromes", submitted to the Data Compression Conference 2023. 

Here are the implemented codes of the investigated time series approximation techniques:
- Piecewise Aggregate Approximation - PAA
- Symbolic Aggregate approXimation - SAX
- Multiple Coefficient Binning - MCB

The implemented codes of the machine learning algorithms used are also available:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Datasets used in this work (before and after the application of time series approximation techniques) are also available, as well as the results of experiments performed for electrome reduction, in terms of compression ratio and space saving, and classification, in terms of accuracy and confusion matrix.

This work is the result of academic efforts by undergraduate and graduate researchers at UFPel (https://portal.ufpel.edu.br/en/) and the authors are available to contact for further clarifications, via email: gdbsedrez@inf.ufpel.edu.br
